# Learning Data Structures

This repository documents my learning process of core data structures in Python. It includes examples and few notes I made in the comments to test my understanding.

## Covered Topics

- Sets (Currently learning)

## Goals

- Understand the underlying operations of each data structure.
- Explore different ways of working with data structures through practical examples.
- Keep notes in the comments for future reference.
- Iterate and refine my understanding through coding sessions.

## Notes

Sets are pretty useful for verifying the existence of an item in a list which is significatnly faster than looking up items in arrays. They're unordered list of unique items.
